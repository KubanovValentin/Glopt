this is my first self-made website. after the 3rd stage of training, the teacher gave a PSD layout without mobile and model template windows and I had to improvise. I used all my knowledge in this project without the help of a mentor, only Google. I have another stage of study and in the future, when creating the next sites, I will be able to do something more. this is where I finished this project,but most likely it has a lot of errors and shortcomings - but they are most likely only due to lack of understanding or knowledge. In the future, of course, I will correct the errors.
